Testing Documents
Notes :
 1. For the TEST CASE Document - I have created Test cases for 4 main Scenarios and have tested the same.
 2. I have reported the defects in JIRA and have attached the link for the same. I have also imported the Jira defect report in word and attached the same with the documents.
 3. Few Issues which I encountered while testing (on sunday) were not reflecting on Monday ( It may be because of software update from iOS 12.1 to iOS 12.2) I have noted those changes in the comment section in Testcase description Document.
